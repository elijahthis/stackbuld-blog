# StackBuld Blog Application

This is a Blog application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts and features a Firebase authentication system. Authenticated users have the ability to create, edit, and delete posts, while anyone can view posts and access the home page. Additionally, users can only edit and delete posts that they have created.

## Features

- **Authentication**: The application utilizes Firebase for user authentication, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform certain actions like creating, editing, and deleting posts.

- **Post Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. Each post includes a title, content, and a banner image uploaded via Cloudinary, with support for drag-and-drop image uploads.

- **Commenting System**: Posts feature a commenting system, allowing users to engage in discussions and leave comments on blog posts.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: The project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, which provides server-side rendering and a fast development experience.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, making it easy to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

- **Firebase**: Firebase is used for user authentication, ensuring secure access to the application's features.

- **Cloudinary**: Cloudinary is used for image hosting and management, enabling users to upload and display banner images for their posts.
